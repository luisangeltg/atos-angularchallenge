      <h1>Challenge Title: Advanced Angular User List App with Filtering and Sorting</h1>

      <h2>Challenge Description</h2>
      <p>Build an advanced Angular application that demonstrates your expertise in Angular components, services, RxJS, SCSS, and Angular Material. Your task is to create an Angular app that loads a list of users from a JSON file, allowing users to filter and sort the user list while adhering to specific guidelines.</p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Set up a new Angular project using the Angular CLI.</li>
        <li>Utilize Angular Material components for a polished UI.</li>
        <li>Design a user interface displaying users' names, emails, and profile pictures using Angular Material components.</li>
        <li>Fetch user data from a provided JSON file using an Angular service and RxJS observables.</li>
        <li>Implement the ability to filter the user list based on either the user's name or email using Angular pipes and RxJS operators.</li>
        <li>Create a toggle button to change the sorting order of the user list between ascending and descending based on the selected sorting criterion (name or email) using RxJS operators.</li>
        <li>Handle errors during data fetching using RxJS observables and display error messages using Angular Material components.</li>
        <li>Implement a loading indicator using Angular Material components during data fetching.</li>
        <li>Employ SCSS to style the user list and UI elements responsively.</li>
        <li>Write unit tests with coverage.</li>
        <li>Write an endpoint to serve the JSON data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>JSON Data Format (users.json)</h2>
      <pre>
        {{
          exampleData
        }},
    // ... more user objects
      </pre>

      <h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>
      <p>Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Correct implementation of filtering and sorting features using Angular Material and RxJS.</li>
        <li>Effective utilization of Angular Material components for UI elements.</li>
        <li>Accurate data fetching and display from the JSON file using RxJS observables.</li>
        <li>Proper error handling and loading indicator implementation using RxJS observables and Angular Material.</li>
        <li>Code quality, modularity, and adherence to Angular best practices.</li>
        <li>Visual appeal, responsiveness, and user experience of the application.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Submission</h2>
      <p>Submit your advanced Angular User List App project (excluding node_modules) through the designated platform.</p>

      <p>This challenge provides an opportunity to demonstrate your comprehensive Angular skills and familiarity with various tools and techniques. Good luck!</p>
